# 6-Month Action Plan for Study Buddy Project

This action plan outlines steps to make meaningful progress on the Study Buddy project over the next six months, beginning after finals on December 13. Each three-week period includes a defined goal, a set of tasks, and extra resources to guide the process.

## **December 13 – January 3: Research and Ideation**

### **Goal:**
- **Understand user needs and refine app features:** Research similar apps to identify key features and pain points. Document findings and finalize the core functionality of Study Buddy.
- **Learn Swift basics:** Gain foundational knowledge of Swift programming to begin the coding phase in subsequent months.
- **Set up the development environment:** Install Xcode and create a sample project to test the setup.

### **Tasks:**
1. Research and list features of 3–5 competitor apps, noting what works well and what doesn’t.
2. Sketch low-fidelity wireframes to finalize the app’s design and navigation flow.
3. Complete an introductory Swift tutorial to learn syntax and basic concepts.
4. Install Xcode and create a simple app to verify the development environment is ready.

## **January 4 – January 24: Build Basic UI and Navigation**

### **Goal:**
- **Create a working prototype:** Build basic UI components and implement navigation between screens based on finalized wireframes.
- **Develop user authentication:** Integrate a simple login and registration system to simulate user account functionality.
- **Improve Swift proficiency:** Focus on advanced Swift topics like closures and structs.

### **Tasks:**
1. Design and implement the main screens (Home, Profile, Search, and Messages) with basic navigation.
2. Create and test a basic user authentication flow using Firebase Authentication.
3. Enhance wireframes with higher fidelity to better align with implementation.
4. Practice creating reusable UI components in SwiftUI.

## **January 25 – February 14: Build Core Functionality**

### **Goal:**
- **Implement study partner matching:** Develop an algorithm that matches users based on input preferences like schedule, study style, and courses.
- **Integrate database functionality:** Use Firebase Firestore to store and retrieve user profiles and preferences.
- **Test basic matching functionality:** Ensure the matching feature works seamlessly by debugging and gathering feedback.

### **Tasks:**
1. Create a user profile setup screen to collect data on preferences and schedule.
2. Implement Firestore integration for storing user profiles.
3. Develop a basic matching algorithm and test it with sample data.
4. Debug any issues with the matching flow and gather initial feedback.

## **February 15 – March 6: Messaging and Scheduling Features**

### **Goal:**
- **Develop messaging functionality:** Add real-time messaging between matched study partners using Firebase.
- **Implement study session scheduling:** Allow users to set up, accept, and manage study session invites.
- **Enhance UI/UX design:** Polish the app’s design for improved usability and aesthetic appeal.

### **Tasks:**
1. Set up Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for messaging functionality.
2. Design and implement a scheduling screen with options for time slots and reminders.
3. Conduct usability testing for both messaging and scheduling workflows.
4. Refine UI with animations or transitions for smoother navigation.

## **March 7 – March 27: Testing and Feedback**

### **Goal:**
- **Conduct extensive testing:** Test all app features (matching, messaging, scheduling) for functionality and usability.
- **Gather user feedback:** Share the app with peers and collect suggestions for improvement.
- **Optimize performance:** Identify and fix bottlenecks in database queries, UI rendering, or algorithms.

### **Tasks:**
1. Write and execute test cases for all major app features.
2. Deploy the app to TestFlight and invite peers to test it.
3. Optimize Firestore queries and refine the matching algorithm for speed.
4. Address user feedback and implement high-priority fixes.

## **March 28 – April 17: Final Improvements and Demo Prep**

### **Goal:**
- **Polish the app for presentation:** Refine all features and fix any remaining bugs.
- **Prepare a demo:** Create a compelling presentation showcasing Study Buddy’s functionality and value proposition.
- **Plan for future development:** Document areas of improvement and additional features to add post-project.

### **Tasks:**
1. Conduct a final round of debugging and polish UI elements.
2. Create a demo script and record a video walkthrough of the app.
3. Write detailed documentation for the project, including a roadmap for future enhancements.
4. Present the app to peers, instructors, or stakeholders and gather final feedback.
