# 6-Month Action Plan for Study Buddy Project

This action plan outlines how I will make progress on the Study Buddy app over the next six months, starting after finals. Since I’m new to Swift, Xcode, and app development, I’ll focus on learning the basics while slowly building features. Each three-week period has goals, tasks, and resources to help me stay on track.

## **January: Learn the Basics**

### **Goal:**
- **Understand Swift and Xcode:** I’ll spend more time learning the basics of Swift programming and getting comfortable with Xcode.  
- **Research other apps:** Look at similar study apps to figure out what features are useful and what I can improve.  
- **Start planning the app design:** Create a simple layout of how the app might look and work.

### **Tasks:**  
1. Research 3–4 study apps and write down what features they have.  
2. Sketch a basic wireframe for the app using pencil and paper or software like Figma.  

### **Extra Resources:**

## **February: Build Basic Screens**

### **Goal:**
- **Create the app’s main screens:** Focus on building the basic Home, Profile, Search, and Messages screens.  
- **Set up navigation:** Learn how to move between screens in the app.  
- **Keep learning Swift:** Practice more complex topics like lists and buttons.  

### **Tasks:**
1. Build simple versions of the main screens using SwiftUI.  
2. Add navigation between screens, like tapping a button to move to the next page.  
3. Watch tutorials about making apps with SwiftUI.  
4. Update the wireframes to make them more detailed as I get ideas.

## **March: Start the Matching Feature**

### **Goal:**
- **Work on the matching system:** Build a way to match users based on their preferences.  
- **Learn how to save data:** Use Firebase to save user information like preferences and schedules.  
- **Test the matching system:** Make sure it works with sample data.  

### **Tasks:**
1. Create a screen where users can enter their study preferences.  
2. Set up Firebase to save and load user data.

## **April: Add Messaging and Scheduling**

### **Goal:**
- **Make a messaging system:** Add a way for users to chat with their study partners.  
- **Create a schedule feature:** Let users plan study sessions and send invites.  
- **Improve the design:** Make the app look nicer and easier to use.

### **Tasks:**
1. Set up Firebase for real-time messaging.  
2. Create a screen for scheduling study sessions with time slots.  
3. Add small design changes like colors and fonts to make the app look better.  
4. Test the messaging and scheduling features.

## **May: Test and Get Feedback**

### **Goal:**
- **Test all features:** Make sure the app works well and doesn’t have big bugs.  
- **Share the app:** Ask friends to try it and give feedback.  
- **Fix problems:** Use feedback to make improvements.  

### **Tasks:**
1. Test every part of the app (matching, messaging, scheduling) to find issues.  
2. Share the app with a small group of friends for feedback.  
3. Fix any bugs or things that don’t work as expected.  
4. Improve the app based on suggestions from testers.

## **June: Polish and Demo**

### **Goal:**
- **Make the app presentable:** Fix any small bugs and finalize the design.  
- **Plan for the future:** Write down ideas for new features and improvements to work on later.  

### **Tasks:**
1. Fix any remaining bugs and make small design updates.  
2. Record a video demo or prepare slides to explain how the app works.  
3. Write a simple roadmap for features to add later.  
4. Present the app to my classmates or instructor.
